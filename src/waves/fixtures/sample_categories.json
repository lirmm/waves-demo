    "short_description": "The idea of a \"tree of life\" arose from ancient notions of a ladder-like progression from lower to higher forms of life (such as in the Great Chain of Being). Early representations of \"branching\" phylogenetic trees include a \"paleontological chart\" showing the geological relationships among plants and animals in the book Elementary Geology, by Edward Hitchcock (first edition: 1840).\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin (1859) also produced one of the first illustrations and crucially popularized the notion of an evolutionary \"tree\" in his seminal book The Origin of Species. Over a century later, evolutionary biologists still use tree diagrams to depict evolution because such diagrams effectively convey the concept that speciation occurs through the adaptive and semirandom splitting of lineages. Over time, species classification has become less static and more dynamic.",

    "short_description": "The construction of a supertree scales exponentially with the number of taxa included; therefore for a tree of any reasonable size it is not possible to examine every possible supertree and weigh its success at combining the input information. Heuristic methods are thus essential, although these methods are vulnerable to biases; the result extracted is often biased or affected by irrelevant characteristics of the input data.\r\n\r\nThe Robinson-Foulds distance is the most popular of many ways of measuring how similar a supertree is to the input trees. It is a metric for the number of clades from the input trees that are retained in the supertree. Robinson-Foulds optimization methods search for a supertree that minimizes the total (summed) Robinson-Foulds differences between the (binary) supertree and each input tree.\r\n\r\nA recent innovation has been the construction of Maximum Likelihood supertrees and the use of \"input-tree-wise\" likelihood scores to perform tests of two supertrees.\r\n\r\nAdditional methods include the Min Cut Supertree approach, Most Similar Supertree Analysis (MSSA), Distance Fit (DFIT) and Quartet Fit (QFIT), implemented in the software CLANN.",

It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases\u2014adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine\u2014in a strand of DNA. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. The rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes of numerous types and species of life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example of the results of automated chain-termination DNA sequencing.\r\nThe first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a DNA sequencer, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster.",
